# Experiencing the Dream: Understanding Drones and Control systems

The Title describes our Project quite elgantly. It was like a dream for me and team-mate to work on this project. But this project isn't about building a simple drone it is much more than a beginner thinks-of while imagining drones. To give you a rough idea, the complexity of our system has made us scratch our heads and gave us many sleepless nights, the very description of which you find later in this blog.

Through this rough journey of learning to work with ROS, designing a controller for a hexacopter, While(1){Understanding **Math**} and understanding **Math**, and debugging, we were selflessly backed and helped by our mentors **Sagar Chotalia**, **Jash Shah**, and **Ayush Kaura**. Thanks to the most dynamic club of VJTI: [Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA)](https://sravjti.in/).

One of the Major questions was **How to make a control system for a drone ?**

>**Seniors**: Just do the Installations first!

### Struggles of the Installations

It now seems like it was too easy to install ROS, Gazebo, and other cloned repo. But it wasn't. I (Alqama) had no idea of how does these things even work, turns out no one really knows, they just install it by checking the versionsðŸ¥². 

First I tried to install as per the instructions given in the [README.md](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator/blob/master/README.md "Readme") of the ETH-ZÃ¼rich (without reading the version it is really for). And then I realised I have downloaded it for 16... some version of ubuntu while we are using 20.04 LTS.

Another shock for me was these tech freaks also name their version. Like kinetic, noetic, and all different sort of things which doesn't have any real world significance. After two days of struggle and adaptation to the idea that, there is no logic in installations here. After Identifying the mistakes they did in the cloning part and debugging their repo. I finally succeeded!
