# Experiencing the Dream: Understanding Drones and Control systems

The Title describes our Project quite elgantly. It was like a dream for me and team-mate to work on this project. But this project isn't about building a simple drone it is much more than a beginner thinks-of while imagining drones. To give you a rough idea, the complexity of our system has made us scratch our heads and gave us many sleepless nights, the very description of which you find later in this blog.

Through this rough journey of learning to work with ROS, designing a controller for a hexacopter, While(1){Understanding **Math**} and understanding **Math**, and debugging, we were selflessly backed and helped by our mentors **Sagar Chotalia**, **Jash Shah**, and **Ayush Kaura**. Thanks to the most dynamic club of VJTI: [Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA)](https://sravjti.in/).

One of the Major questions was **How to make a control system for a drone ?**
