# Overview
Everything around us working to make our lives easier is nothing but systems.
How they interact with the environment and what should be their behavior is decided by th control over the systems which we have. By combining real life parameters, system variables, and control of the user we can make a control system.

## Types of systems
- ### Linear : 
    These are very ideal form of systems which don't really represent the real world scenario. But these systems are often used along side with the non-linear system to make a program faster and doesn't involve extra computation which is usually required for the non-linear type of systems.
- ### Non-linear :
