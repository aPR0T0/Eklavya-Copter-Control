## Concept of rosmsg, rostopic, and rosnode

Consider a scenario when you are talking to your friend on your phone.
Here, you and your friend are the `nodes`. 
* rosnodes : So, these are basically the users or programs that publish or subscribe to any information
> How to know everything about your nodes?
> 
The network or line you are using for the communication is the `topic`, or you may even consider your conversations topic
* rostopic : So, It is just the channel through which you have to transfer the data
