## Scenario
Consider a hexacopter that we are using here, suppose we have set the cartesian co-ordinates w.r.t the body frame of refernce.
Now, if we want to fly the hexacopter to (x,y,z) cordinates (here, we ar not bothering the control system, we are just understanding whats happeining) it may offshoot from the point by (dx,dy,dz) term in order to get back at the desired position we should add or subtract the error.

## Types of error terms

* **Integral**:
