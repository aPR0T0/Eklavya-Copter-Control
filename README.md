<!--ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Drone aviation is an emerging industry. With possibilities for its applications in agriculture, healthcare, e-commerce as well as traffic control. We wanted to get first hand experience with how a drone is designed as well as how it flies to get a firm grasp on the principles needed to work with drones in the future.  
Our full project report can be found [here]()

## Project workflow
- To learn about different control systems and make gazebo simulation of a modelled hexacopter by ETH-ZÃ¼rich
- Make the control system
- Implementation

### Tech Stack

- [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic)
- [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites and installlation
* Tested on [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)
* [Gazebo Sim](http://gazebosim.org/)
* Do visit these websites for the installation steps of the above mentioned software. It is recommended to install Gazebo along with ROS and not seperately

### Installation

[Installation Guide](./Installations.md "Installation")

### Execution
Open two terminal windows and run the following commands
- Terminal 1

```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch rotors_gazebo mav.launch mav_name:=omav
```
- Terminal 2
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
cd ~/Eklavya-Copter-Control/simulation/rotors_gazebo/scripts
chmod +x .                      
python3 control_omav.py
```

<!-- FUTURE WORK -->
## Future Work
- [x] Create a control system for the drone using PID
- [x] Stabilise the Roll, Pitch and Yaw of the Drone 
- [x] Get the drone to fly at any arbitrary altitude
- [x] Have the drone fly to given co-ordinates and stabilise itself
- [ ] To make copter fly with an arbitary orientation at a given position
- [ ] Implement obstacle avoidance
