# Eklavya'22 - Copter Control

Learning about Control Systems, Types of Drones, Types of Rotors.

Controlling a Hexacopter with Co-axial tilt rotors in Simulation ( **Gazebo** ), understanding the various dynamics of such a system and creating a controller that will enable a stable positioning system with multiple functionalities.

The copter we are considering is a hexacopter with tilt brushless motors. 


> Project Workflow
- To learn about different control systems and make gazebo simulation of a modelled hexacopter by ETH-ZÃ¼rich.
- To learn about types of drones and types of rotors.
- Make the control system.
- Implementation

# Welcome to Notes
Here, we have gathered all the basic concepts to understand our project in depth.
The following concepts are foundation of Overactuated MAV with tilt configuration in other words hexacopterðŸ˜Š 
- [x] Basics of PID

- [x] How to use git
- [x] Linear Algebra
- [x] Vehicle Dynamics
- [x] Basic of Control Theory
- [x] How to write an effective markdown (With the cheat sheets) 

## Project Implementation on Ubuntu 20.04 for ROS NOETIC
