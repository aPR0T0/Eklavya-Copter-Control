# Eklavya-Copter Control


Controlling a hexacopter with coaxial tilt rotors in simulation, understanding the various dynamics of such a system and creating a controller that will enable a stable positioning system with multiple functionalities.

The copter we are considering is a hexacopter with tilt brushless motors. 

> ## Project workflow
- To learn about different control systems and make gazebo simulation of a modelled hexacopter by ETH-ZÃ¼rich
- Make the control system
