# Eklavya'22 - Copter Control

Learning about Control Systems, Types of Drones, Types of Rotors.

Controlling a Hexacopter with Co-axial tilt rotors in Simulation ( **Gazebo** ), understanding the various dynamics of such a system and creating a controller that will enable a stable positioning system with multiple functionalities.

The copter we are considering is a hexacopter with tilt brushless motors. 


> Project Workflow
- To learn about different control systems and make gazebo simulation of a modelled hexacopter by ETH-ZÃ¼rich.
- To learn about types of drones and types of rotors.
- Make the control system.
- Implementation
